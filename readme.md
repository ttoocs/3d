#What are .scad?
 * They're openSCAD files. openSCAD is free and cross-platform, and can just be installed locally.

#What is here?
 * A simple parametric raft, using simple spacing. (Better than the default UP3D one)
 * A simple parametric lego technic bar. (Also has a raft edition, using the above raft file)
